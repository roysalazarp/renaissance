## The Problem

It turns out that piling code on top of code doesn't work for creating simple, reliable, secure, and performant software.

## The Solution

Remove the 30 million lines of code that "make your life easier" and instead give the hardware the necessary instructions to perform the task at hand.

## How?

Manipulate memory in a software process using variables, loops, if statements, and arraysâ€”nothing much more, really. For this, I am using C, a simple programming language that provides very little abstraction over machine code.

That's it, really.
